# Mean-stack-project-support-desk
<p> MEAN stack project support desk is a web application that provides a platform for users to submit and manage support tickets related to a specific software project built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js). The purpose of the application is to facilitate communication between users and the development team, allowing for efficient and effective resolution of issues.

The support desk typically includes features such as ticket submission, ticket tracking, notifications, and user management. Users can submit new tickets, view their existing tickets, and receive updates on the status of their tickets. The development team can use the application to manage and prioritize tickets, assign tickets to specific team members, and communicate with users about the status of their tickets.</p>
